                        Operator Overloading

1. Define a class Complex with appropriate instance variables and member functions.
   Define following operator in the class:
   1. +
   2. - 
   3. *
   4. ==


2. Create a class Time which contains hour, min and second as fields. 
overload greater than(>) operator to compare two time objects.

3. In Question 2, overload pre - increment and post-increment operator to increment
Time object value by one second.

4.In Question 2 , Overload operator + to add Time Objects. 

5. Define a class matrix to represent 3X3 matrix. Provide appropriate instance
methods. Also define operator + , operator - , operator * to perform addition, 
subtraction and multiplication operations respectively.


6. Consider following class Numbers 

    class Number
    {
        int x, y , z;
        public:
        // methods
    };

    Overload the Operator unary minus(-) to negate the numbers.

7. Define a C++ class fraction 

class fraction
{
    long numerator;
    long denominator;
    public:
    fraction (long n=0 , long d=0);
};
Define an operator + to add two fraction object. 

8. In Question 7 , define an operator < to compare two fraction objects.

9. Consider a class Distance

class Distance 
{
    int km, m , cm ;

    public : 
    // methods
};
Overload the operator + to add two Distance objects. 


10. In Question 9 , define operator pre decrement and post decreent to decrease 
distance by 1 cm. 

11. Consider the following class Array 
 
 class Array 
 {
    int *p;
    int size;

    public:
     //methods
 };

Define constructor to allocate an array of given size(size is given through parameter)
Define a subscript operator to access element at given index. Define destructor to deallocates the memory of array .
