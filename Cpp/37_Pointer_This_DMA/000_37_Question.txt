                        -----------------------------------

1. Define a class Person with name and age as instance variables. Provide parameterised constructor with two formal arguments name & age, to initialise instance variables.

2. Define a Class Complex with instance variables a and b to store real and imaginary part of a complex number . Provide setData() method with formal arguments with the name a and b , to set the values of instance variables. Also define showData() method to display instance member variable values. 

3. In question 2 , write a non member function in which instantiate Complex class dynamically. Initialise instance variables and display their values.


4. Define a class Distance with instance varialbes hr, min and sec. Provide instance methods setTime() and showTime(). setTime() method has formal arguments with the same name as instance variables. Also define setters and getters.

5. In question-4, define a method to dynamically create and array of Time Objects with specified size(received through argument) and return array.

6.In question-4,define a method to sort Time object array.

7.In question-4, define a method to display Time object array values. Array is received through argument. 

8.Define a Class String with char pointer and length of the string as instance member variables. Define a method to dynamically create an array of char type and hold the input string in such a way that the array length is just enough to accommodate the input string.


9. In question-8, define methods to convert string into uppercase, lowercase. 

10. In question-8 , define methods to print string , return string, return length of string.
