                        Member fucntion, static 

1. Define a class Complex to represent a complex number with instance variables a and b 
to store real and imaginary parts. Also define following member fucntions 
    1. void setData(int, int )
    2. void showData()
    3. Complex add(Complex)
    4. Complex substact(Complex)
    5. Complex multiply(Complex)


2.Define a class Time to represent a time with instance variables h , m and s to store 
hour  , minute and second . Also define following member fucntions
    1. void setTime(int, int, int )
    2. void showTime()
    3. void normalize()
    4. Time add(Time)
    5. bool is_greater(Time)

3.Define a class TestResult with properies roll_no, right , wrong , net_score. Also 
define class properies right_weightage, wrong_weightage.Provide methods to set
and get all the properies. 

4.Write a driver fucntion main() to use TestResult class(Question 3). Create an array 
to 5 TestResult Objects, set values to all the objects and display the results in sorted
order (by net_score).

5. Define a class Matrix to represent a 3X3 order matrix. Provide appropriate methods
and properies to the class. Also define following methods in the class:
    1.Matrix add(Matrix)
    2.Matrix sub(Matrix)
    3.Matrix multiply(Matrix)
    4.Matrix transpose()
    5.bool is_singular()
